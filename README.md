# DS-as-a-Field-Final-Project
Repository for two final projects for the Data Science as a Field course. 
These include an NYC Shooting Analysis project and a COVID 19 Analysis project both completed in R.

The NYC Shooting Analysis utilizes the Historical NYC Shooting Incident Data Set fround at the URL below
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic from the website https://catalog.data.gov/dataset

The COVID 19 Analysis utilizes data from John Hopkins GitHub Repository specifically the "csse_covid_19_data" branch.
We made use of the below files specifically - 

1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
3. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv
4. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
5. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv

The first four files are confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US, confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, COVID-19 deaths in US, and COVID-19 deaths globally.
The fifth file was used primarily to add country population to the global data sets.
